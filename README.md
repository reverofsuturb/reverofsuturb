### About Me

Born in Boston and raised in the mountains of Colorado, I've cultivated a diverse background in hospitality and am transitioning into the tech industry. With experience ranging from waitstaff to restaurant management, and from retail cannabis inventory specialist to Whole Foods order writer, I bring adaptability and a strong work ethic to any team. I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments and am committed to honing my craft and contributing as a productive member of the team. My strengths lie in teamwork, communication, and a detail-oriented approach to tasks. I'm self-motivated, eager to learn, and not afraid to seek guidance when needed. I'm passionate about growth, both personally and professionally, and am excited about the opportunity to grow with a company while making meaningful contributions along the way.

Well that felt formal.
